Aadhaar Strategic Insight Engine (ASOE) 🚀
UIDAI Hackathon 2026 Submission Theme: Data-Driven Governance & Service Delivery Optimization
Submitted By: Vinay Pandey (SAGE University, Indore)
📋 Project Overview
The Aadhaar Strategic Insight Engine (ASOE) is a Python-based analytical pipeline designed to detect hyper-local "pressure events" and "service blackouts" in Aadhaar enrolment data.
Standard reporting often relies on simple counts, which masks underlying issues. This engine moves beyond descriptive analytics to predictive intelligence, using Robust IQR (Interquartile Range) outlier detection to filter statistical noise and identify true administrative anomalies across 4.9 million records.
🛠️ Tech Stack & Methodology
Language: Python 3.13 (Jupyter Notebook)
Data Processing: Pandas (Dataframes), NumPy (Statistical Robustness)
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (Custom Professional Themes)
Statistical Logic: * Recursive Ingestion: "Smart Hunter" script to locate fragmented datasets.
Entity Resolution: String normalization for district name matching.
IQR Method: Non-parametric outlier detection to handle skewed population distributions.
📊 Key Analytical Findings
Signal
Finding
Implication
Administrative Surge
Mahasamund flagged as 4.8-Sigma Outlier
Indicates mass address updates due to district boundary changes/schemes, not standard migration. Requires "Bulk Update" counters.
Service Blackout
Bengaluru Rural flagged (Compliance < 1%)
Critical failure of stationary centers in rural peripheries. Requires immediate "School Camp" deployment.

🚀 How to Run
Clone the Repository:
git clone [https://github.com/codevinay1/UIDAI-Hackathon-2026-ASOE.git](https://github.com/codevinay1/UIDAI-Hackathon-2026-ASOE.git)
cd UIDAI-Hackathon-2026-ASOE


Install Dependencies:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn


Prepare Data:
Place your UIDAI CSV files (Enrolment, Demographic, Biometric) inside a folder named Data/. The notebook is configured to find them recursively.
Run the Analysis:
Open analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
Run all cells to generate the reports and visualizations.
📂 Repository Structure

*.png: Visual insights generated by the engine (Administrative Pressure, Service Gaps, Strategic Matrix).
README.md: Project documentation.
This project was developed for the UIDAI Hackathon 2026 to demonstrate the power of open-source tools in optimizing public service delivery.
